%% This is a sample startup file for the slrn newsreader and meant as a
%% template for your personal startup file; it is not a full reference
%% of slrn's config options -- please see the reference manual for this.

%% The percent character is used for comments.

%
%% 1. Tell slrn about your identity (name, email address and such)
%

% The "From:" header will be generated from the following three variables.
% With the example settings, it would read "John Doe <john@doe.com>"
%set username "john"
%set hostname "doe.com"
%set realname "John Doe"

% Set this if you want replies to your articles to go to a address different
% from the one in "From:".
%set replyto  "John Doe <jdoe@something.com>"

% What to put into the "Organization:" header line.
%set organization "Doe inc."

% The name of your signature file.  If "", no signature is added.
%set signature ".signature"

include "etc/private/slrn/slrnrc"


%
%% Macros
%

% use slrnmime mime integration
include "/usr/share/slrnmime/mime.slrnrc"

% leafnode fetch and post integration
interpret "etc/slrn/fetchnews.sl"

% make the article pager behave like in mutt / newsbeuter
interpret "etc/slrn/muttpager.sl"

% use gpg with slrn
interpret "etc/slrn/gnupg.sl"

% create scorefile entries by pressing one single key
interpret "etc/slrn/onekey-score.sl"

% misc macros e.g. wrapper functions for keybindings
interpret "etc/slrn/my_macros.sl"

%
%% 2. Server specific settings
%

% Tell slrn which newsrc file it should use for which server.
% Note: This does *not* set the default server; you need to set the
%       NNTPSERVER environment variable for this.
%server "news.doe.com" ".jnewsrc-doe"

% If a server requires authentication, add a nnrpaccess line for it.
% If you leave username and/or password empty, slrn will prompt for it.
%nnrpaccess "news.doe.com" "john" "secret"

% Some servers require authentication, but don't ask for it.
% To offer your authentication data "voluntarily", set this variable to 1.
%set force_authentication 0

% This can either be set to "nntp" (read online) or "spool" (use local spool)
%set server_object "nntp"

% This can be "nntp" (post directly to the server), "inews" (use external
% program for posting) or "slrnpull" (spool message for slrnpull to send).
%set post_object "nntp"

% Set this to zero if you want to leave Message-ID generation to your server
% or your system does not have a proper unique hostname.
set generate_message_id 1

% If non-zero, slrn reads the active file on each startup.  You might want to
% use this if your network connection is fast or the server has few groups.
%set read_active 0

% The following variables are only meaningful when using spool mode:

% Basic directory settings
%set spool_inn_root "/var/lib/news"
%set spool_root "/var/spool/news"
%set spool_nov_root "/var/spool/news/over.view"

% These are relative to spool_inn_root unless they start with "/".
%set spool_active_file "data/active"
%set spool_activetimes_file "data/active.times"
%set spool_newsgroups_file "data/newsgroups"

% This value is relative to the directories under spool_nov_root:
%set spool_nov_file ".overview"

% Whether to check for each article when reading an overview file (slower,
% but may save you from lots of "article not available" errors).
%set spool_check_up_on_nov 0

%
%% 3. Which external programs do you want to use?
%

% Note OS/2 and Win32 users: 
%   To separate directories you can either use a single '/' or
%   double '\\'. Single backslashes are not supported.  For example, use
%   "C:\\home\\file.txt" or "C:/home/file.txt" but NOT "C:\home\file.txt"

% Set your favourite editor.  Use %s for the file name and %d for the line
% where the cursor should be placed (usually at the beginning of the body).
%set editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp"
set editor_command "vim -c %d '%s'"

% You can have separate commands for editing posts, mail, and score files.
%set mail_editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp --mail-mode"
%set post_editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp --mail-mode"
%set score_editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp --score-arrange-score"

% If non-zero, abort posting or email operation if the file was not modified
% by the editor.
set abort_unmodified_edits 1

% In case we need metamail to display an article:
%set metamail_command "metamail"

% WWW browser to use. Xbrowser is used when the DISPLAY environment variable
% is set; non_Xbrowser otherwise.
set non_Xbrowser "elinks '%s'"
set Xbrowser "firefox '%s' &"

% Command to use for printing
% Note: On Win32, this variable defines the name of the printer queue to use.
%set printer_name "lpr -Plp"

% In case you want to use another mailer than sendmail.  Be sure that it
% implements the same interface, though!
%set sendmail_command "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t -oem -odb"

% Set this to one if you want the "From:" header in e-mails to be generated
% from the hostname / username / realname variable.
% Note: Not all MTAs are configured to allow this.
%set generate_email_from 0

%
%% 4. Directory / file names
%

% Note: All filenames in this section are relative to HOME unless they start
%       with a '/'.

% Filename where articles / email you sent are archived.
% Note: If these are unset, slrn does not keep a copy of outgoing messages.
set save_posts "News/My_Posts"
set save_replies "News/My_Replies"

% File where failed posts are appended.  Use "" to disable saving.
%set failed_posts_file "dead.letter"

% Name of score file.
set scorefile "etc/slrn/scoring"

% Name of directory where decoded files are placed.
set decode_directory "News"

% Directory where all other files are saved.
set save_directory "News"

% Directory where postponed articles are placed. Please make sure it exists.
set postpone_directory "News/postponed"

% Whether to put temporary files for postings, followups and replies in the
% directory specified by the TMPDIR environment variable or /tmp.
set use_tmpdir 1

%
%% 5. Attribution lines / custom headers
%

% This sets the attribution lines for follow-ups and replies.  The following
% format specifiers are recognized:
%  %d:date, %D:date (formatted), %r:real name, %R:first name,
%  %f:email address, %s:subject, %m:msgid, %n:newsgroups, %%: percent
set followup_string "%r <%f> wrote:"
set reply_string "%r <%f> [%n]:"

% Custom headers to add to *new* posts
%set custom_headers "Mail-Copies-To: nobody"

% Custom headers for followup/reply/supersedes.  These can use format
% specifiers as in the 'followup_string' variable.
%set followup_custom_headers "Mail-Copies-To: nobody"
%set reply_custom_headers "X-newsgroup: %n\nX-realname: %r"
set supersedes_custom_headers "X-Superseded-Date: %d"

% This is inserted when sending email CCs of your postings.
set cc_post_string "[This message has also been posted to %n.]"

%
%% 6. Character mapping / MIME support
%

% Character set used for the display or terminal; valid values include:
%   utf-8, iso-8859-1, ibm850, ibm852, koi8 
% Use if your system does not detect it automatically from locale settings 
charset display utf-8

% the character set used for outgoing articles
charset outgoing "utf-8"

% If non-zero, call metamail for MIME formats slrn cannot handle.
%set use_metamail 1

%
%% 7. Some preferences for the header window (see the manual for more)
%

% These sorting methods are available:
% If 0, do not sort.  If 1, perform threading.  If 2, sort by subject.
% If 3, thread then sort result by subject.
% If 4, sort by score.  If 5, thread then sort by score.
% If 6, sort by score and subject.
% If 7, thread, then sort by score and subject.
% If 8, sort by date with most recent first.
% If 9, thread, then sort by date with most recent first.
% If 10, sort by date with most recent last.
% If 11, thread then sort by date with most recent last.
% If 12, use the value of the custom_sort_order variable.
set sorting_method 7

% If non-zero, a header with a new subject will start a new thread.
set new_subject_breaks_threads 0

%
%% 8. Some preferences for the article pager (see the manual for more)
%

% Which headers do you want to see by default?
% You can also match all headers starting with a given string and exclude
% specific headers by preceding them with "!" (e.g. use "X-,!X-Trace:" to
% display all the "X-"headers except "X-Trace:").
visible_headers "Subject:,From:,Organization:,Newsgroups:,Date:,Followup-To:,Reply-To:,Message-ID:,Supersedes:,User-Agent:,X-Mailer:,X-Newsreader:,X-Posting-Agent:,X-Http-User-Agent:,X-,!X-Trace:,!X-Complaints-To:,!X-Face:,!X-MSMail-Priority:,!X-MimeOLE:,!X-Priority:,!X-Accept-Language:,!X-Received:,!X-Originating-IP:,!X-Yahoo-Profile:,!X-Yahoo-Newman-Property:,!X-Yahoo-Newman-Id:,!X-Yahoo-Post-IP:,!X-eGroups-Msg-Info:,!X-eGroups-Approved-By:"

% If non-zero, #v+ and #v- will be interpreted as markers of verbatim lines.
set process_verbatim_marks 1

% If non-zero, hide #v+/#v- verbatim marks.
%set hide_verbatim_marks 0

% If non-zero, hide signature in articles.
%set hide_signature 0

% If non-zero, hide PGP signature in articles.
%set hide_pgpsignature 0

%
%% 9. Display / color settings
%

% If non-zero, slrn will draw the thread tree using simple ascii characters
set simulate_graphic_chars 1

% Enable xterm/win32 mouse support: 1 to enable, 0 to disable
%set mouse 0

% Draw cursor bar ala tin instead of slrn "->" cursor?
set display_cursor_bar 0

% Set to 1 to have slrn scroll by full page instead of by line.
set scroll_by_page 0

% Should color be used to indicate the score of an article?
% (0) scores do not influence colors (1) scores are colored by their value
% (2) subjects are colored by score  (3) both are colored by score
set color_by_score 3

% If non-zero, the subjects of unread articles are highlighted
set highlight_unread_subjects 2

% If non-zero, URLs are highlighted.
set highlight_urls 1

% Enables blinking in monochrome mode and allows bright backgrounds in some
% color terminals:
%set use_blink 1

% Setup actions we want slrn to ask confirmation for (confirm_actions)
% It's set as an integer, the default is 31 which means that for everything
% below slrn will ask for confirmation

% 1     Confirm marking groups as read or un-read.
% 2     Confirm printing an article.
% 4     Confirm posts, followups, replies and supersedes.
% 8     Confirm leaving a group by following a news: URL.
% 16    Confirm quitting slrn.

set confirm_actions 10 % 2 & 8
%set confirm_actions 31   % 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16

% create_score(...)
%
% 1. score type - can be 's' for "Subject", 'f' for "From" or 'r' for
%    "References"
% 2. score value - the score for the entry
% 3. scope - 't' if the entry should apply to the current ("This") group,
%    'a' if it should have an effect in all groups.
% 4. date of expiry - can either be a date string (in format MM/DD/YYYY or
%    DD-MM-YYYY) or an integer. If it is an integer, it will be
%    interpreted as how long from now (in days) the entry should remain
%    valid; if it is zero (or negative), the entry will never expire.
% 5. apply immediately - if non-zero, the scorefile is reloaded, so the
%    new entry is applied immediately.
